# IIBM Bootcamp 2022
**Instructors**: Carlos Valle (cgvalle@uc.cl) & Gabriela Vargas (givargas@uc.cl)


Class materials for the IIBM Bootcamp to be held between January 17 and 21 of 2022. During the 5 days, practical excersices in relation to Programming (Python), Calculus and Algebra will be teached, been the main objective to equip studens of the postgraduate programs of the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering (IIBM)](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/) with tool that will be necessary to sucdeed in the different courses of the programs.

Jupyter notebooks and additional material for each of the days will be uploaded here.

## **Learning Objetives**
* Adcquire basic programming skills
*  Apply programming tools
* Design basic scripts
* Explain chosen methods and obtained results to an interdisciplinary and diverse audience
* Contrast the results critically and respectfully with different people
